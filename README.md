Loan Prediction Project: End-to-End Workflow

**Objective:** 
Build a complete loan prediction system from raw data to deployed web app.

1. Data Collection & Exploration

* Dataset includes features like `Gender`, `Married`, `Dependents`, `Education`, `Self_Employed`, `ApplicantIncome`, `CoapplicantIncome`, `LoanAmount`, `Loan_Amount_Term`, `Credit_History`, `Property_Area`.
* Checked missing values, distributions, and imbalanced target (`Loan_Status`).

2. Feature Engineering & Preprocessing

* **Missing values:** Filled numeric with median, categorical with most frequent.
* **Outliers:** Applied Yeo-Johnson transformation.
* **Encoding:**

  * Ordinal labels: `Gender`, `Married`, `Education`, `Self_Employed`, `Credit_History`
  * One-hot: `Dependents`, `Property_Area`
* **Balancing:** SMOTE to handle imbalanced target.

3. Model Training & Evaluation

* Trained multiple models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost).
* Best model: **XGBoost** with mean accuracy \~0.83.

4. Full Pipeline

* Created a **preprocessing pipeline** for numeric, ordinal, and one-hot features.
* Combined preprocessing and model into a **single pipeline** for ready-to-predict raw data.

```python
full_pipeline = Pipeline([
    ("preprocessor", preprocessor),
    ("classifier", xgb_model)
])
```

5. Front-End Deployment

* Built **Streamlit app** with sliders and dropdowns for user inputs.
* Users can enter raw features and get real-time loan predictions.
* Example feature:

  ```python
  Loan_Amount_Term = st.slider("Loan Amount Term (days)", 12, 720, 360)
  ```

Conclusion

* Demonstrated **end-to-end ML workflow**: preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, evaluation, pipeline creation, and deployment.
* Focus: **clean, structured ML process** rather than just maximizing accuracy.
